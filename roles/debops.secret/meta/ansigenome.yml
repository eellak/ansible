  synopsis: |
    This role enables you to have a separate directory on the Ansible Controller
    (different than the playbook directory and inventory directory) which can be
    used as a handy "workspace" for other roles.
    
    Some usage examples of this role in [DebOps](http://debops.org/) include:
    
    - password lookups, either from current role, or using known location of
      passwords from other roles, usually dependencies (for example
      the `debops.mysql` role can manage an user account in the database with
      random password and other roles can lookup that password to include it in
      a generated configuration file);
    
    - secure file storage, for example for application keys generated on remote
      hosts (`debops.boxbackup` role retrieves client keys for backup
      purposes), for that reason secret directory should be protected by
      external means, for example encrypted filesystem (currently there is no
      encryption provided by default);
    
    - secure workspace (`debops.boxbackup` role, again, uses secret directory
      to create and manage Root CA for backup servers â€“ client and server
      certificates are automatically downloaded to the Ansible Controller, signed
      and uploaded to destination hosts);
    
    - simple centralized backup (specific roles like `debops.sshd`, `debops.pki` and
      `debops.monkeysphere` have separate task lists that are invoked by custom
      playbooks to allow backup and restoration of ssh host keys and SSL
      certificates. Generated .tar.gz files are kept on Ansible Controller in
      secret directory).
